# Webflow Build System
A simple Grunt build system to optimise sites exported with Webflow. 
## Getting Started
This a simple, but scalable build system template that is easy to use especially if you've ever used Grunt before. Even if you have't, hopefully through these instructions you can utilise the system. 
### Prerequisites
There are  a couple things you will need to make sure Grunt runs correctly. Firstly make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then test NPM is installed by typing the following in your terminal.
```
npm -v
```
### Set Up
To get the build system up and running, test to see if git is installed by running the following in your terminal
```
git --version
```
then `cd` into a chosen directory and run
```
git clone https://github.com/kierglover/webflow-build-system.git
```
You should then have the `package.jason` and the `Gruntfile.js` in your chosen directory. 
### Running the System
To make sure everyhting is ready to go, run the following in your projects root directory (`.documents/mywebsite/` for example).
```
npm install
```
